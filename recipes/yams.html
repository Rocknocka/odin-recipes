    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a simple and quick way to enjoy a Thanksgiving favorite! Canned yams or sweet potatoes may be used.</p>
        <p>I've made this recipe twice and it was enjoyed by all. One thing you must try is adding cinnamon after adding the butter, it is so much better, 
        add enough to lightly dust the entire thing, add more or less depending on your taste. 
        I forgot to add it in the second batch and everyone said it was missing something and wasn't as good, I realized then that I forgot the cinnamon!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (29 ounce) can sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups miniature marshmallows</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Drain sweet potatoes and place in a medium baking dish. Distribute butter pieces evenly over the sweet potatoes. 
                Sprinkle with brown sugar. Layer with miniature marshmallows</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven 25 minutes, or until sweet potatoes are tender and marshmallows have melted.</li>
